## Features

- **Accurate Intel 8080 CPU emulation** - Full implementation of all 8080 opcodes
- **Authentic display rendering** - Color zones matching original arcade cabinet (green, red, white)
- **Browser-based** - Runs entirely in the browser using WebAssembly
- **Authentic audio** - Sound effects via Web Audio API with correct UFO looping behaviour
- **Cross-platform** - Runs on any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Mobile support** - On-screen touch controls for phones and tablets
- **Pause** - Press **P** to pause and resume at any time
- **Persistent high score** - High score is saved in browser `localStorage` and restored on next visit

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)

## Build and Run

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

Then open your browser to `https://localhost:5443` or `http://localhost:5000`.

## Publishing for Production

```bash
dotnet publish -c Release
```

The release build has **WebAssembly AOT compilation** enabled (`<RunAOTCompilation>true`). This compiles .NET IL to native WASM instructions at publish time, giving lower CPU usage and more consistent frame timing at the cost of a longer publish step and a larger initial download. The extra size is served Brotli-compressed by most static hosts, which reduces the impact significantly.

> **Note:** AOT compilation requires the `wasm-tools` .NET workload. If the publish step fails with a missing workload error, install it once with:
> ```bash
> sudo dotnet workload install wasm-tools
> ```

## Startup

Startup has two screens in both Debug and Release builds:

1. **Initial loading screen** (`wwwroot/index.html`) — displays “Loading emulator...” while Blazor WebAssembly loads.
2. **Start screen** (`Pages/Index.razor`) — lists the keyboard controls and waits for you to select **START** before loading and running the emulator.

Both screens display the same transparent green PNG icon, `wwwroot/invader-icon.png`, at 256 × 186 pixels on desktop, scaled down on mobile.

Once the emulator is running, insert a coin with **C** and press **1** or **2** to play. No password or PIN is required. Missing ROM files prevent startup; missing sound files show a warning with a **CONTINUE WITHOUT SOUND** button.

## Controls

### Desktop (Keyboard)

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **C** | Insert Coin |
| **1** | 1 Player Start |
| **2** | 2 Player Start |
| **←** / **→** | Move |
| **Space** | Fire |
| **P** | Pause / Resume |

### Mobile (Touch Controls)

On mobile devices a set of on-screen touch buttons is displayed below the game screen, replacing the keyboard hints shown on desktop. The buttons are arranged in two rows that match the width of the game canvas:

| Row | Buttons |
|-----|---------|
| **Top** | **1P** (1 player start) · **COIN** (insert coin) · **2P** (2 player start) |
| **Bottom** | **◀** (move left) · **FIRE** · **▶** (move right) |

Mobile detection is automatic — touch controls appear only on phones and tablets, while desktop users continue to use the keyboard as normal.

## ROM Files

Place the following ROM files in the `wwwroot/roms/` directory:

| File | Address Range | MD5 Checksum |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| `invaders.h` | 0x0000 - 0x07FF | `E87815985F5208BFA25D567C3FB52418` |
| `invaders.g` | 0x0800 - 0x0FFF | `9EC2DC89315A0D50C5E166F664F64A48` |
| `invaders.f` | 0x1000 - 0x17FF | `7709A2576ADB6FEDCDFE175759E5C17A` |
| `invaders.e` | 0x1800 - 0x1FFF | `7D3B201F3E84AF3B4FCB8CE8619EC9C6` |

## Sound Files

Place WAV sound files in the `wwwroot/sounds/` directory:

- `ufo_lowpitch.wav`
- `shoot.wav`
- `explosion.wav`
- `invaderkilled.wav`
- `fastinvader1.wav`
- `fastinvader2.wav`
- `fastinvader3.wav`
- `fastinvader4.wav`
- `extendedPlay.wav`

## Technical Details

- **CPU Clock**: 2 MHz emulated
- **Display**: 224x256 (rotated 90° from original 256x224)
- **Refresh Rate**: 60 Hz
- **Color Overlay**: Simulates original arcade color gel overlay
  - Green: Player and shields area
  - Red: UFO area at top
  - White: Middle play area

### Display Realism

The original cabinet mounted the CRT horizontally, reflecting the image through a half-silvered mirror angled at 45° over a backlit artwork panel. Game pixels appeared to float over the background scene with natural transparency. Several effects recreate this:

- **Background image** — cabinet artwork is composited beneath the game canvas.
- **Half-mirror transparency** — CSS screen blending causes unlit pixels to be fully transparent, letting the background show through, while lit pixels dominate — faithfully replicating the mirror effect.
- **Background dimming** — the artwork is darkened in CSS to simulate the light attenuation of the half-silvered glass.
- **Vertical scanlines** — a GPU-composited CSS overlay mimics the phosphor column structure of the CRT with no runtime CPU cost.
- **Colour zones** — the original cabinet used coloured cellophane strips over the screen. Pixel colours are rendered with a subtle blue bias to replicate the characteristic tint of CRT phosphors rather than pure digital colour.

### Rendering Architecture

Game logic and rendering run on separate timers to avoid tearing and correctly handle high-refresh-rate displays:

- **Game logic** — driven by a C# `PeriodicTimer` at 60 Hz. Each tick runs one full frame of 8080 CPU cycles, collects sound triggers, and writes the pixel buffer to a JS `ImageData` object via `updateFrame()`.
- **Rendering** — driven by a JS `requestAnimationFrame` loop. Each VSync it flushes the latest `ImageData` to the canvas via `putImageData()`. This keeps drawing aligned with the display's paint cycle regardless of whether the display runs at 60, 120, or 144 Hz.

### Audio

All sounds use the Web Audio API (`AudioContext` + `AudioBuffer`). Sounds are decoded once at load time and played by creating a new `AudioBufferSourceNode` per trigger — giving low latency and correct overlap without DOM node leaks. The UFO hum (`ufo_lowpitch`) is treated as a sustained level signal: it loops continuously while port 3 bit 0 is high and stops when the bit falls, matching the original hardware behaviour.

### High Score Persistence

The high score is persisted in browser `localStorage` under the key `spaceInvadersHighScore`. On startup the stored value is decoded and written directly into the ROM's BCD RAM (`0x20F4–0x20F5`) so the game displays it natively from the first frame. It is saved once per game, triggered by detecting the ROM's `gameMode` flag (`0x20EF`) transitioning from `1` to `0` — the ROM's own authoritative end-of-game signal.
